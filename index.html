               <h3>Pilot(s):Duo Maxwell</h3>
               <p>The Gundam Deathscythe looks like a Winged Grim Reaper. To be honest that's why it makes it on this list and will everytime. I mean just look at it! It also has a giant sycthe hence the name "Deathscythe" and is piloted by Duo Maxwell. </p>
