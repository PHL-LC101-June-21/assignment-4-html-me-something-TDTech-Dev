               <p>Piloted by 14 yr old Shinji Ikari the EVA Unit  01 is a sleek and human like mech. When piloted correctly and with weapons like the "progressive knife" it's almost unstoppable. It also has cool powers like limb regeneration and a berserker rage. </p>

               <h3>Pilot(s):Tai Kamiya and Matt Ishida</h3>
               <p>Omnimon is a mech-like digimon that actually isn't piloted by anyone but is actually two digimon combined into one. They are powered by the power of friendship of humans Tai and Matt! Ominimon looks like an ethereal white knight with a giant sword and arm cannon to match.</p>

               <h3>Pilot(s):Duo Maxwell</h3>
               <p>The Gundam Deathscythe looks like a Winged Grim Reaper. To be honest that's why it makes it on this list and will everytime. I mean just look at it! It also has a giant sycthe hence the name "Deathscythe" and is piloted by Duo Maxwell. </p>
